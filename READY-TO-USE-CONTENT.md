### Post 4: Thread Starter
```
I built a tool that discovers APIs and generates code in 12 languages. Here's how it works 🧵

1/ APX Toolkit automatically discovers APIs from any website by watching network traffic. No API specs needed - just provide a URL.

2/ It then generates:
• Code in 12 languages (TypeScript, Python, Go, Java, etc.)
• Complete documentation (OpenAPI, Postman, cURL)
• Test suites (Jest, pytest, Mocha)
• SDK packages ready to publish

3/ Result: 2-4 weeks of developer work → 10 seconds

Excited to share APX Toolkit - a tool I built that solves a problem I've faced many times: integrating with APIs takes weeks of manual work.

APX automatically:
✅ Discovers APIs from any website (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket)
✅ Generates code in 12 programming languages
✅ Creates complete documentation (OpenAPI, Postman, cURL, Insomnia)
✅ Builds test suites in 5 frameworks
✅ Publishes SDK packages (TypeScript, Python, Go)
✅ Performs security audits
✅ Generates mock servers and performance reports

The result? 2-4 weeks of work completed in 10 seconds.

Perfect for developers who need to integrate with APIs quickly, whether you're building a new feature or documenting an existing API.

## 🎬 Demo Video Script

**Script for 2-3 minute demo:**

```
[0:00-0:15] Introduction
"Hi, I'm [name] and I built APX Toolkit to solve a problem I've faced many times: integrating with APIs takes weeks of manual work."

[0:15-0:30] The Problem
"Normally, you'd have to:
• Manually discover API endpoints
• Write code in your language
• Create documentation
• Build test suites
• Publish SDKs

This takes 2-4 weeks."

[0:30-1:00] The Solution
"APX Toolkit does all of this automatically. Let me show you how it works."

[1:00-1:30] Demo
"First, I go to the Apify Actor page. I paste a URL - let's use example.com. I click Start. APX automatically discovers all APIs the site uses - REST, GraphQL, WebSocket - it finds them all. Then it generates code in 12 languages, creates documentation, builds test suites, and publishes SDK packages."

[1:30-2:00] Results
"Look at all the outputs:
• Code snippets in 12 languages
• Complete documentation
• TypeScript types
• Test suites
• SDK packages
• Mock servers
• Performance reports

All of this in 10 seconds."

[2:00-2:30] Conclusion
"APX Toolkit saves weeks of work in seconds. Try it free at console.apify.com. Link in description. Thanks for watching!"
