# 🎯 Complete Compliance Guide - Step by Step

**Date**: November 27, 2025  
**Goal**: Make APX Toolkit 100% compliant with Apify $1M Challenge

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Prerequisites Discovered

Before we can configure monetization and publish, we need to:

1. **Fill in Categories** in "Display information" section
2. **Configure Monetization** (Pay per usage or Pay per event)
3. **Publish to Store**
4. **Check Quality Score** in Insights

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Fill in Categories (REQUIRED FIRST)

**Location**: Publication tab → Display information section

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to: https://console.apify.com/actors/2eXbQISXqhTnIxWNJ/publication
2. Scroll down to find the **"Display information"** section
3. Look for **"Categories"** field (may be a dropdown, multi-select, or text input)
4. **Add appropriate categories** for APX Toolkit:
   - **Recommended categories**:
     - `Developer Tools`
     - `API Tools`
     - `Code Generation`
     - `API Documentation`
     - `Web Scraping` (optional)
     - `Automation` (optional)
5. Save the categories

**Note**: If you can't find the Categories field, it might be:
- In a collapsed section (click to expand)
- Below the fold (scroll down)
- In a form that needs to be opened

---

### Step 2: Configure Monetization (CRITICAL)

**Location**: Publication tab → Monetization section

**Steps**:
1. Still on the Publication tab
2. Scroll to find the **"Monetization"** section
3. Select monetization type:
   - **Recommended**: **"Pay per usage"** (standard compute-based pricing)
   - **Alternative**: **"Pay per event"** (per result/item pricing)
4. Save the monetization setting

**Why "Pay per usage" is recommended**:
- Standard pricing model for API tools
- Users pay for compute time/resources used
- More predictable for users
- Better for tools that process data

---

### Step 3: Publish to Store

**Steps**:
1. After filling Categories and setting Monetization
2. Scroll to the bottom of the Publication tab
3. Click **"Publish on Store"** button
4. Follow any confirmation dialogs
5. Wait for publication to complete

**After Publishing**:
- Actor will be live on Apify Store
- Quality Score will be calculated
- Actor will be eligible for Challenge rewards

---

### Step 4: Check Quality Score

**Location**: Insights tab

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to: https://console.apify.com/actors/2eXbQISXqhTnIxWNJ/insights
2. Look for **"Quality Score"** or **"Actor Quality"** section
3. Verify the score:
   - ✅ **If ≥ 65**: You're compliant!
   - ⚠️ **If < 65**: See "Improving Quality Score" below

**Expected Score**: 70-85/100 (based on your comprehensive README)
